# libft

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful standard functions. 
This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing them in C and learning to use them. 
I have expanded my libft to implement more functions, so I can reuse them again on the next projects.

## How to use

1. Use `make` to compile it without bonus functions or `make bonus` to compile with bonuses (linked lists functions).

1. Add them to your program using `-lft -L path/to/libft.a -I path/to/libft.h` when compiling the source code.
